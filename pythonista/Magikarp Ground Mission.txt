Question:

Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? 
Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin.
 Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `481e7b14`

 Method :
Press the launch instance to get the port to use

Run it on your terminal
 ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 53752

when prompted, enter the password given ie. 481e7b14
ls once connected to begin
cat the 1of3flag.txt to read the contents in the file
   cat 1of3flag.txt
   the first part of the flag will be shown:
       picoCTF{xxsh_
read the instructions-to-2of3.txt
  cat instructions-to-2of3.txt
   the instructions read:
      Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`

to get to the root, you'll need to use the cd/ command
check the contents of the root directory using the ls command

read the contents of 2of3.flag.txt
   cat 2of3.flag.txt
   the second part of the flag will be shown:
      0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

read the instructions-to-3of3.txt
   Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
cd home 
gets you the next part of the flag

 cat 3of3.flag.txt
 the third and last part of the flag will be shown:
   1118a9a4}

Answer:

  picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_1118a9a4}
